## **About Me**

Hi~ I am **Tianyu Gao**, a third-year undergraduate student from the **Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University**. I am advised by [Professor Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) and affiliated with [Tsinghua Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science Lab (THUNLP)](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/site2/). My research interests lie within the intersection of natural language processing, deep learning, information extraction and knowledge graphs.

## **Publications**

**Hybrid Attention-Based Prototypical Networks for Noisy Few-Shot Relation Classification** <br>**Tianyu Gao**\*, Xu Han\*, Zhiyuan Liu and Maosong Sun. (* indicates equal contribution)<br>_To appear in proc. 33rd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2019_

* Tackle the problem of few-shot relation classification in noisy scenario.
* Add instance-level attention and feature-level attention to Prototypical Networks.
* Achieve great improvement on accuracy and convergence speed compared to baseline models.

## **Projects**
