        <p>I tried to track arXiv papers under cs.CL to learn about the recent progress in NLP. However, such tracking usually breaks when there are a burst of papers, for example, when near an anonymous DDL. My solution to a hundred arXiv tabs opened has been always cmd+Q (a “hard-reboot”, as Southwest Airlines would call it). I realized I always missed piles of interesting papers and relying on Twitter/slack recommendations made me extremely biased of what’s going on. So I decide this time to put in some more effort to go through December’s arXiv papers.</p>

<p>After EMNLP, NLP forks all left Abu Dhabi except me, staying here to renew my US visa. Sadly, my visa is under “administrative processing” and I have to wait for an “indefinite” period of time. Flying back home (China) is also extremely unaffordable due to lack of flight, so I spent Christmas and New Year wondering around the area, traveling around UAE, Oman, Morocco, and Turkey. While traveling around is lonely, I can also use the time to read some papers and experience being a “digital nomad”.</p>

<p>Ok let’s get down to business. This paper list focuses on new papers coming out on arXiv in December 2022 (some might be revision). I am mainly interested in the following directions and the list reflects them too: retrieval (LMs and retrieval; dense retrieval) and LLM (in-context learning; instruction tuning; prompting; generation; efficient use of LLM). Let me know if you find other interesting papers that I didn’t mention!</p>

<h2 id="retrievallm-a-path-to-faithful-and-generalizable-llm">Retrieval+LM: a path to faithful and generalizable LLM?</h2>

<p>We have seen a lot of hype brought by GPT-3 and ChatGPT, especially how they can answer questions with “facts”, memorized in their parameters. But such behaviors are not generalizable — a model trained in 2022 wouldn’t know any news in 2023 — and also have hallucination issues — the answers are not supported by any explicit documents and may be inaccurate.</p>

<p>Adding a retrieval component to LMs can be a remedy. We have seen works adding entity knowledge to LMs (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07129.pdf">Zhang et al., 2019</a>),</p>
